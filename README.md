## üìù Overview

In Week 5, we covered essential IO programming topics and deep-dived into powerful Java features:

- **CSV Data Handling:** Reading, writing, parsing CSV files, and validating CSV data.  
- **JSON Data Handling:** Introduction to JSON, reading and writing JSON data, parsing, and JSON schema validation.  
- **Annotations and Reflection:** Overview of built-in and custom annotations, annotation processing tools, using reflection for inspecting and manipulating Java code at runtime, and applying design principles.
